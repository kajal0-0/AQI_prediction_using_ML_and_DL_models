# AQI_prediction_using_ML_and_DL_models
I built a deep learning model using LSTM to predict Air Quality Index trends. I fine-tuned hyperparameters to improve model accuracy and reduce overfitting. The project involved analyzing government-sourced AQI data to ensure reliable predictions for practical usage.
